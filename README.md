# JARVIS Voice Assistant

JARVIS is a simple voice assistant implemented in Python. It uses speech recognition and natural language processing to understand and respond to voice commands.

## Features

- Speech recognition: JARVIS listens to voice commands and converts them into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- Natural language processing: The assistant uses intent prediction to understand the user's command and generate appropriate responses.
- Text translation: JARVIS can translate the user's commands into English using the `googletrans` library.
- Text-to-speech: The assistant can respond to the user's commands by converting text into speech using the `speak` library.

## Note
 -makes use of a intent recognzing model
- JARVIS uses the English language for command recognition and response. However, you can speak in your preferred language, and JARVIS will translate it to English before processing.
- The accuracy of the speech recognition and natural language processing may vary depending on the environment and the user's pronunciation.
- we are still working on it to improve and add more functionalities
